# personal-website-pt2
You have been recently hired at FullStack Solutions as a junior developer. Your project manager, Calliope, sends you the following email to welcome you to the team and provide details on your first assignment. Calliope has asked you to create a personal site with a brief bio. It is a chance to show off who you are, what you are about, and what you have accomplished. We will focus on three main areas: the landing page, an about page, and a portfolio page.
